## Overview  
**PHASE_C** (Post-Quantum High-Assurance Encryption) is a C++-based framework designed to secure data against quantum computing threats. It leverages post-quantum cryptographic algorithms to provide robust, efficient, and scalable encryption for modern applications.  

---

## Features  
1. **Quantum-Resistant Encryption**  
2. **Secure Key Exchange Mechanism**  
3. **High Performance and Efficiency**  
4. **Layered Security Architecture**  
5. **Scalability and Adaptability**

## Installation  
### Prerequisites  
- C++17 or later  
- A modern C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC)  
- CMake (for build automation)  

### Steps  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/n0tShayan/PHASE_C.git  
   cd PHASE_C  
   ```  
2. Create a build directory:  
   ```bash  
   mkdir build && cd build  
   ```  
3. Build the project:  
   ```bash  
   compile the code:  
   ```bash
    g++ server.cpp server_utils.cpp crypto.cpp -o server -lws2_32
     g++ client.cpp -o client -lws2_32

4. Run the application:  
   ```bash  
   ./phase_c  
   ```

## Usage  
1. Generate a quantum-resistant key pair using the provided CLI or API.  
2. Establish a secure channel via the post-quantum key exchange mechanism.  
3. Encrypt and decrypt data using the encryption APIs.
